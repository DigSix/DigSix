## Hello there!👋

### [Diogo Viana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diogo0110)

Developer focused on systems analysis, automation, and practical problem-solving through software.

I enjoy understanding how systems work end-to-end — from infrastructure and containers to business rules and automation logic. My work is guided by clarity, simplicity, and usefulness.



### About Me

- Computer Science student at Universidade do Vale do Itajaí (UNIVALI)
- Background in IT support, infrastructure, and user assistance
- Currently working with system support and internal IT processes
- Strong interest in automation, backend logic, and system reliability

I started my career outside of tech and transitioned into IT through hands-on experience. That path shaped how I approach software: solving real problems, not just writing code.



### Current Focus

- Systems analysis and IT support  
- Automation of repetitive tasks  
- Small and practical software solutions  
- Understanding business rules and translating them into code  

Most projects here are experiments, utilities, or learning artifacts — each one teaching something real.



### Tech Stack

**Languages & Tools**
- Python
- Node.js
- SQL
- Git

**Frontend**
- Svelte / SvelteKit

**Infrastructure**

> I prioritize tools that are simple, composable, and easy to solo dev.
