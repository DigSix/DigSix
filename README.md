# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Diogo (DigSix) Viana

I'm currently a Computer Science student at UNIVALI, working as Software Support at Cootravale, and building my path as a fullstack developer.
I love getting my hands dirty and learning by creating real projects â€” whether it's replicating something I saw in class or testing a random idea from scratch.
Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into IA, APIs, Databases, Microservices and 3D with Three.js.

##  What Iâ€™m up to

-  College (Computer Science â€” 6th semester)
-  IT Support Technician (Focused on software support)
-  I use AI as a helper to speed up my learning process â€” responsibly, of course
