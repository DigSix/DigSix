### Hello there!

I'm [Diogo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diogo0110), a developer focused on systems analysis, automation, and practical problem-solving through software.

I enjoy understanding how systems work end-to-end — from infrastructure and containers to business rules and automation logic. My work is guided by clarity, simplicity, and usefulness.

### About Me

- Computer Science student at Universidade do Vale do Itajaí (UNIVALI)
- Background in IT support, infrastructure, and user assistance
- Currently working with system support and internal IT processes
- Strong interest in automation, backend logic, and system reliability

I started my career outside of tech and transitioned into IT through hands-on experience. That path shaped how I approach software: solving real problems, not just writing code.

### My Stack

**Backend**
- Python
- Node.js
- SQL

**Frontend**
- SvelteKit

**Infrastructure & Tools**
- Docker, Git, Nginx
- Basic Linux, networking concepts

> I prioritize tools that are simple, composable, and easy to solo dev.
